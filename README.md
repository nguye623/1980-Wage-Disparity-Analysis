# 1980-Wage-Disparity-Analysis
## Project Background

Our nonprofit's Economic Research and Equity Division has launched a historical wage study to understand long-term trends in racial wage gaps. The goal is to identify patterns from past decades to add context regarding current policy recommendations. The team reached out to conduct a detailed statistical analysis using a dataset from 1980 that contains demographic and wage data for a sample of male workers.

## Analysis Results Summary

This analysis explores potential wage disparities between black and non-black male workers in the United States during the 1980â€™s. Revealing the following key findings:
* Non-black men earned higher average wages than their black counterparts, and a two-sample T-test confirmed statistically significant differences.
* Education level positively correlated with wage across both groups, though the gap remained consistent after accounting for educational attainment.
